Used the skills that we have learned in the Defensive Security unit to design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization. 
- We used Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for our fictional organization. 
- We determined whether that monitoring solution will protect our organization from several simulated attacks.
- We showcased our defensive projects with class presentations.
