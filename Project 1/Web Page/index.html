        <h2 class="section-title">Hi, I'm Linda!</h2>
        <p>
                    I decided to start my own web blog because I want to get more females interested
                    in cybersecurity.  My goal is to help women feel more comfortable and
                    confident in the cybersecurity space by giving them information about the 
                    industry.  Enjoy some blogs that I think are interesting in the industry.

                <h3>Date Breaches</h3>
                <h4>How to succeed after failure.</h4>
                <p>In today's digital age, data breaches are becoming more and more common. 
                   However, what separates successful businesses from those that fail is how they handle
                   the aftermath of the date breach.  It's important to acknowlege the breach and take responsibility for any mistakes made. 
                   Businesses should assess the damage and take steps to mitigate any harm caused by the breach.
                   They should then review their security protocols and update them if necessary. 
                   They should communicate openly and frequently with their customers to keep them informed about the siuation and any steps being taken to address it. 
                   Businesses should consider offering compensation or other incentives to affected cusomers as a gesture of goodwill. 
                   They should work closely with law enforcement and other experts to investigate the breach and identify any perpetrators. 
                   They should learn from their mistakes and use the experience to imporove their security practices. 
                   The business should be transparent about their data collection and use practices, and only collect the data that they need to provide their services. 
                   They should regularly test their security systems and protocols to identify any vulnerabliites before they can be exploited. 
                   Finally, businesses should prioritize their customers' privacy and security at all times, and be proactive in addressing any concerns or issues that may arise.
