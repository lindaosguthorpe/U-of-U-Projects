## **What Is BootCon?**

BootCon is a mock cybersecurity conference. It takes place during class, and you will have an opportunity to showcase the skills that you’ve learned throughout the course with a presentation to the class. This “conference” occurs on the last day of the course and will also count as the final project.


## **What Is a BootCon Presentation?**

Cybersecurity professionals commonly present the following to their peers:
-Security research that they're conducting
-Newly discovered security vulnerabilities of products, devices, software, or hardware
-Demonstrations of the “hacks” that will exploit these vulnerabilities
-Mitigations to protect against these vulnerabilities

These presentations often occur at security conferences, trade shows, and other industry events.

All students of the Cybersecurity bootcamp have a similar opportunity to showcase the skills they learned during the bootcamp with a bootCon presentation.

Most cybersecurity professionals present at conferences when they've found a new vulnerability. However, for bootCon presentations, it is acceptable and recommended that you recreate a finding that has already been discovered.



## **BootCon Presentation Rules and Requirements**
## **Cover the following rules and requirements for bootCon presentations:**


1. This was a group project. We had to submit and recieve approval for our project before proceeding. Our project summary included:

-Topic and title of your presentation
-End goal or vulnerability being exploited
-List of devices and/or technologies that will be used to accomplish the goal
-Summary of how the devices and technologies will be used to accomplish the goal



2. ⚠️ UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE MAY ANY ASPECT OF OUR BOOTCON PRESENTATION BE UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL. ⚠️

-We must perform all hacks and tests in simulated environments.
-We must complete any network connections in our own home and/or controlled environments.
-We may only perform IOT hacks on devices that we personally own.



3. Presentations must have a goal whose achievement we can demonstrate.

For example:


-Goal: DoS an IoT Device


-Demonstration: Demonstrating how we used DoS on a IoT Device. 



We conducted our presentation live and we walked through what has taken place.



4. We submitted our presentation in the form of a Google Slides deck that, at a minimum, included the following:


Cover slide: Presentation title and team member(s) presenting.

-Technical background:

-Explanation of why we selected the topic that we are presenting.
-Networking, cryptographic, or security concepts applied.
-Research steps taken.



-Demonstration preview: Preview of the steps that we took in the upcoming demonstration.

-Demonstration: A live or recorded demonstration is conducted here.

-Demonstration summary: Summary of the demonstration that we just conducted and any impact that it may have.

-Mitigation: Recommendations for mitigating against the attack that we just conducted. 



5. We presented our project on the last day of class, and our total presentation time was 7 - 10 minutes.
